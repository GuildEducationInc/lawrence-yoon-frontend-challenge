# Guild's Frontend Take-Home Challenge

Thanks so much for taking the time to show off some of your skills! Take-home projects/coding challenges come in all shapes and sizes. Some are great and some are terrible. We've worked really hard to create a challenge that not only gives us some insight into your abilities as an engineer, but one that is also fun to work on.

You may use either `js` or `ts` (boilerplate found in the corresponding directories). You may use the boilerplate we are providing you for the frontend piece of this challenge or you may choose to scrap it. You may use any framework you wish (the boilerplate is [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)).

## The challenge

Assuming you use the boilerplate, there is a substantial amount of the work already done, but it still needs some love. Using [these mockups](https://www.figma.com/proto/v9fqT2hneqq5hnc4sYYQb4/Chat-App?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=5%3A3&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.03&scaling=scale-down-width), please make any necessary changes to get the app looking more like what the design team had in mind.

### What we are looking for:

- [Software Engineer I/II Requirements](SE_REQUIREMENTS.md)
- [Senior Software Engineer I/II Requirements](SSE_REQUIREMENTS.md)

Don't break your neck over this! Please limit the time you put in to complete the project to between two and four hours (seriously, we don't want you spending more than four hours on this). If you have any questions please reach out to your recruiting coordinator at Guild.

Good luck.

## Running the app

To start the boilerplate(s) run either `yarn ts` or `yarn js` from the root of the project.

## Deliverying your code

Please create a branch for your work off of `main` in this repository. When you are ready to submit the project, open a PR into `main` from your feature branch, assign the repository creator (most likely the hiring manager you spoke with on the phone) as a reviewer and let your Guild recruiting coordinator know that you're done.
